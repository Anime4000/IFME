- At Deinterlaced (Yadif) zone:

		Deinterlace only frame
		Deinterlace each field
		Skips spatial interlacing frame check
		Skips spatial interlacing field check

		Top Field First
		Bottom Field First

		Deinterlace All Frames

- At the Main Windows of the Software, please can you add a code for the "Untitled" can be translated? I had added
  a translation for wne nasking for to save without a name. So this will add coherence, i think.


The other codec presets, is better to left them in their original english names, due to they are technical names
