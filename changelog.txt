Version 8.2.2 (Mondnachtmelodie)
--------------------------------
[Fixed] Media files no longer default to MKV upon import; they now follow the currently selected output format container.
[Fixed] Non-MP4 and non-MKV format containers (e.g., AVI) always burning subtitles by default
[Fixed] Bug fix on multiple subs from another video that only extract once
[Update] Added subtitle support for MP4 containers (SRT, VTT). Issue #228 found by @longwu9t
[Update] Updated x265 to 3.6+27-8787e8702 (master branch)

Version 8.2.1 (Himmelsreise)
----------------------------
[New] Added VVC Encoder (uvg266 version 0.8.0) for experimental requests, issue #227
[Dev] MKV container currently gives an incorrect VVC FourCC to the player (shows as V_QUICKTIME), causing video playback issues. MP4, TS, and M2TS are working correctly for now.
[Update] Updated FFmpeg to 2024-06-16 to support VVC bitstream
[Update] Updated MP4Box to 2.4.0 to support VVC bitstream
[Update] Updated Rigaya NVEnc to 7.54

Version 8.1 (Celestial Equations)
--------------------------------
[New] Implemented a method to permanently embed subtitles into videos without requiring `fonts.conf`.
[Fixed] Resolved an issue with incorrect usage of `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from NuGet, ensuring compatibility across systems and preventing JSON-related bugs.
[Fixed] Adjusted the default splash screen fade duration from 1ms to 5ms to accommodate faster computers where the quick fade was too abrupt.

Note: After many years in beta, IFME is now out of beta thanks to the discovery of a method for correctly embedding styled subtitles without the need for `fonts.conf`. This method was uncovered while examining Jellyfin FFmpeg Encoding logs. It may seem trivial, but previous search results often suggested using `fonts.conf`.

Version 8.0 beta 13 (Eternal Descent)
-------------------------------------
[New] Embrace the Breeze: Introducing automatic cropping and letterbox removal. This feature, independent of stream copy and video resolution, ensures a seamless cropping experience without resizing.

Version 8.0 beta 12 (Luminar Spectrum)
---------------------------------------
[Fixed] Precision Polishing: Corrected a minor typo in the Chroma Subsample Pixel (CSP) handling. The issue involved incorrectly appending the Bit Depth for non-YUV formats. Special thanks to Shiniori-raws for bringing this to our attention.
[Optimization] Cutting-Edge Performance: IFME now ships with AVX2-enabled encoders (x265, x264) for optimal utilization of modern processors such as AMD Ryzen, Threadripper, Epyc, or their Intel equivalents. Please note that this change may render IFME incompatible with non-AVX2 processors.

Version 8.0 beta 11 (Celestial Cascade)
---------------------------------------
[New] Welcome Rigaya NVEnc: Introducing Nvidia Video Encoder support for GPU-based video encoding.
[Fixed] Progress in Motion: Now seamlessly integrates Rigaya NVEnc console output into the status display for a more comprehensive monitoring experience.

[Note] Rigaya's Contribution: Rigaya has also developed Intel Quick Sync and AMD VCE plugins, though we couldn't add support in this release due to a lack of hardware for validation. Feel free to explore the plugins in `Plugins\rigaya_nvencc\_plugin.video*` and make replacements as needed.

Version 8.0 beta 10 (Digital Horizon Symphony)
----------------------------------------------
[New] Introducing the "original" option in the Combo Box List; selecting it will use the original value.
[Fixed] Addressed conflicts with the "-vf" filter when applying crop operations.
[Fixed] Clarified the functionality of "auto" resolution, now truly adaptive based on the "-vf" or any specified parameters.
[Fixed] Resolved an issue where, if the FFmpeg "-vf" contained the "crop" parameter, the resolution would be set to "auto."

Note: This changelog is improved by OpenAI ChatGPT from my broken English input.

Version 8.0 beta 9 (Enigma Ascension)
-------------------------------------
[New] IFME now capable to become a Ingest Station Server where IFME watch the folder for any new file and encode based on user settings

Version 8.0 beta 5 (Mana)
-------------------------
[New] Expanded hardware acceleration support, including Intel Quick Sync (av1, h265, h264, vp9), Nvidia NVENC (h264, h265, av1), and AMD AMF (h264, h265).
[New] Added filename examples to demonstrate the final name when using Prefix and Postfix, making it easier for users to understand the naming convention.
[Fixed] Eliminated spaces in Postfix filenames.
[Fixed] Enabled a factory reset option for users to reset settings.
[Fixed] Resolved an issue (issue #223 reported by MrxHellsing) related to program hang caused by auto values.

Version 8.0 beta 4 (Prolog auf Erden)
-------------------------------------
[New] Introduced AV1 NVENC support in test mode, although testing was limited due to a lack of suitable hardware for encoding and quality adjustment.
[Update] Updated FFmpeg to BtbN builds, version N-109027-g202b7a9ae7 (shared, GPL).

Version 8.0 beta 3 (Kurzes Epos)
--------------------------------
[Fixed] Addressed IFME crashes on certain computers due to "Tabs Init" occurring before WinForm loading, causing different behavior when run via VS IDE and Standalone.
[Fixed] Allowed "Fast Remux" to work alongside "Trim"; when "Trim" is in use, it no longer skips the "Fast Remux" process.
[Fixed] Enabled "Fast Remux" to work with "Image Sequence."
[Fixed] Fixed issues related to Plugins Init (Test Encoder) with incorrect exit codes, ensuring proper encoder usage.
[Change] Modified Plugins Init (Test Encoder) to skip CPU encoders and test only GPU encoders unless "TestRequired" is set to true.
[Change] Made AV1 show total progress, enabling IFME to display the overall completion percentage.
[Change] Rearranged AV1 presets in reverse order, similar to x265 and x264, with the last item indicating slower encoding for higher quality and lower bit-rate.
[Update] Errors during plugins initialization are now shown in the log instead of the Splash Screen.

Version 8.0 beta 2 (Aufbruch)
-----------------------------
[Change] Metadata about "Writing Application" now displays IFME version, platform, and CPU architecture, making it easier to troubleshoot issues related to encoding versions.

Version 8.0 beta 1 (Erdentempel)
--------------------------------
[New] Introduced "Fast Remux" feature, allowing users to remux files when the codec is compatible with the target file container. Otherwise, it encodes to a compatible codec. Useful for cases where a wrong codec (e.g., AVI) in Jellyfin/Plex is encoded to H.264.
[New] Enabled folder import functionality for scanning and importing all Jellyfin/Plex media.
[Fixed] Refined the interpretation of FFmpeg return codes, where IFME now treats positive 1 as OK or a warning.
[Change] Deprecated "Copy Stream" due to the addition of the "Fast Remux" feature.
[Change] No longer ships CPU-specific x264/x265 encoders, as non-AVX processors cannot use them.
[Update] Updated x264 to version 3.5+56-8c159ba54.
[Update] Updated x265 to version 0.164.3094.
[Update] Updated SVT AV1 to version 1.3.0.
[Update] Updated FFmpeg to version 2022-10-27-git-00b03331a0-full.

It's been a while since IFME was under ALPHA release. I was concerned about potential bugs that might have gone unnoticed during testing. Now, IFME has entered the BETA stage, and all bugs and GUI glitches have been ironed out. I hope it functions as expected.

Furthermore, this 8th iteration of rebuilding the GUI from scratch has made it incompatible with previous versions. I understand that I'm not a professional programmer, but I've done my best. Sometimes, I get confused by FFmpeg's exit codes, as they can return random positive numbers. I recently discovered that the exit code reflects the total number of processed frames. All these years, I've been mistaken. I've realized that trying to understand FFmpeg's code on my own, without seeking help, was a bad idea. I'm not sure where to turn for assistance, and I'm afraid the community might become frustrated with my inquiries.
